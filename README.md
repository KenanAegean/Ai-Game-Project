## First Assigment
### First Assigment Description
```
AI – Assignment

Intro
In order to complete the assignment, the character “Kim” will have to navigate to the
finish line, specifically in the scenes – Level1, Level2, Level3. Kim is powered by AI, that
you will have to create!
To get started - download the “AI_BaseGame” unity project on omniway. Once inside
there is a script called “Kim.cs”, This is where you implement your ai.
Note: You should not change the code base. But you can use it! Fetch tiles from the
Grid singleton for example.

G :
• Kim navigates to finish line using Dijkstra's algorithm
• Kim can avoid zombies
• Kim uses either State machine or Behavior tree

VG :
• Kim navigates to finish line using A*
• Kim can avoid zombies
• Kim can go towards burgers
• Kim uses behavior tree

Handing in
To hand in : Submit a unity project in a zipped folder to omniway. Remember to remove
the “Library” folder inside the unity project.
